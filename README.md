- In the mobile view, the order of the features list is incorrect: 

I fixed this challenge by assigning a unique ID to each of the element that needs reordering when displayed in mobile view. Then through CSS media querie I assigned the reorder property to each of the elements according how I wanted it to be displayed on mobile view.

- In desktop, mobile, and tablet view, the call-to-action button hover, focus, and active states do not match the spec: I add a hover color to the button class property in css to change the its background color each time its clicked 

- In desktop, mobile, and tablet views, the person icon in the navigation bar is too large in comparison to the spec: I added and equal width and hiegth of 23px to the icon property 

- In the mobile view, the position of the error message is incorrect: Add a posotional change property

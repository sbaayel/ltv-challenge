- In the mobile view, the order of the features list is incorrect: I fixed this challenge by assigning a unique ID to each of the element that needs reordering when displayed in mobile view. Then through CSS media querie I assigned the reorder property to each of the elements according how I wanted it to be displayed on mobile view.
